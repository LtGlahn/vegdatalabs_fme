===============

Introductory material for reading data from the Norwegian Road database api (REST interface) https://www.vegvesen.no/nvdb/api/. Contains @LtGlahns presentation at #FMEWT (FME world tour) 6.5.2014, Oslo, and some sample FME workspaces. 
The presentation should provide valuable clues and hints about how to get started with the example work spaces. Please note that the location of the xfsmap definition file (xfmapDefintion_nvdbapi2fme.xml) in the XMLFeatureReader transformer must be adjusted to match your local file system.
